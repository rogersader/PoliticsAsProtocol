# ProvinceOnChain  
### Protocol Mapping of Canadian Provincial Governments

This section applies the 9-layer model to **provincial governance**, which controls the majority of citizen-facing systems: health, education, land, housing, policing, and municipalities.

## Provincial Governance Components

### Core Institutions  
- **Legislative Assembly** (unicameral)  
- **Premier & Cabinet (Executive Council)**  
- **Lieutenant Governor** (constitutional role)  
- **Provincial courts** and rights frameworks  
- **Ministries** (Health, Education, Housing, Natural Resources, etc.)

### Provincial Authority Domains  
- Health care  
- Education (K–12, postsecondary)  
- Housing and land use  
- Municipal creation & oversight  
- Civil law (in Quebec)  
- Natural resource management  
- Provincial policing

## On-Chain / Hybrid Potential

- Provincial registries (health, land titles, corporate, tenancy)  
- Participatory budgeting at the ministry level  
- Zoning & land-use feedback loops  
- Provincial rights-impact tagging  
- Transparent provincial-municipal data interfaces

## Why Provinces Are Ideal Pilot Targets

They have:  
- High autonomy  
- High service density  
- Direct accountability  
- Manageable scale vs federal systems  

Provinces naturally map well onto modular governance protocols.
