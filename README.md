Politics as Protocol – Overview

This repository explores how governance systems can be modeled and executed as protocols, and applies that framework to Canada’s political structure at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels.

The goal is to treat politics the same way we treat distributed systems:
actors, rights, decisions, processes, and safeguards expressed as formal, composable layers that can run on-chain or hybrid on/off-chain.

The repo contains:

1. The Base Governance Protocol Model (9 Layers)

A reusable framework describing how any political system can be represented as a protocol:

Governance Domain Model – actors, rights, decision types, resources

Identity & Access – digital credentials, eligibility proofs

Representation & Delegation – direct voting, liquid democracy, elected roles

Proposal & Deliberation – idea → proposal → review → vote → execution

Voting Protocol – privacy, verifiability, tallying

Policy Encoding & Enforcement – laws, budgets, regulations, treasury

Constitutional & Oversight – rights analysis, vetoes, watchdogs

Infrastructure – blockchain layer, clients, interoperability

Security & Inclusivity – accessibility, recovery, threat modeling

This is the conceptual foundation for everything else in the repo.

2. Canada – Federal Mapping

A concise mapping of the 9-layer model to Canada’s federal institutions, covering:

Parliament (House of Commons, Senate)

Prime Minister, Cabinet, Governor General

Federal courts & the Charter

Elections Canada, ridings, FPTP

Federal powers (ss.91–92), budgets, laws, regulations

Opportunities for on-chain layers:

Bill & regulation hashing

Digital credentials for voters

Delegation graphs

Non-binding referenda

Treasury visualization

Charter-alignment tagging

Shows how the protocol model fits the federal governance architecture.

3. Provincial Mapping

Applies the same protocol layers to provincial governments, which control most high-touch services:

Provincial legislatures, Premiers, Cabinets, Lieutenant Governors

Health, education, natural resources, policing, housing

Provincial courts and human rights codes

Riding-based elections (MLAs, MPPs, MNAs)

Municipal oversight via provincial statutes

On-chain opportunities:

Provincial registries (health, land, business)

Planning & development feedback cycles

Provincial participatory budgeting

Rights-impact scoring + s.33 monitoring

Governance dashboards for ministries and agencies

Provincial governments emerge as ideal mid-scale protocolization targets.

4. Municipal (City) Mapping

The most flexible and innovation-ready layer:

Mayors, councillors, ward systems

Bylaws, zoning, permits, local planning

Infrastructure, transit, water, waste, emergency services

Public consultations and community planning

On-chain opportunities:

Bylaw / zoning registry

Digital municipal ID (residency-based)

Ward governance channels

Participatory budgeting

Permit lifecycle transparency

Procurement auditing

Neighbourhood-level governance modules

Cities become natural sandboxes for real-world protocol governance pilots.

5. What This Repository Provides

A unified conceptual framework for turning governance into protocol logic

Three full government layer mappings (federal, provincial, municipal)

Clear separation of:

What can go on-chain now

What must remain off-chain

What can be hybridized

A starting point for building:

Digital governance apps

Civic identity systems

Participatory budgeting tools

On-chain legislative tracking

Rights-aware governance engines

Protocolized city governance
