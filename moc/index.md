### Cities as Protocol: Zoning, Budgets, Permitting, Representation

This section maps the 9-layer governance model to **municipal government**, the most agile and innovation-ready layer of governance.

## Municipal Components

### Political Structure  
- **Mayor** (executive role)  
- **City Council** (deliberation + representation)  
- **Standing committees** (planning, budget, transit)  
- **Wards & councillors** (local representation units)

### Operational Domains  
- Zoning & land-use planning  
- Building permits  
- Public works (roads, water, waste, transit)  
- Emergency services  
- Recreational services  
- Local taxation & budgeting  
- Procurement & vendor systems

## On-Chain / Hybrid Opportunities

- **Zoning/Bylaw registry** (versioned, queryable, auditable)  
- **Permit lifecycle tracking** (applications → approvals → compliance)  
- **Neighbourhood feedback loops** (digital ward governance)  
- **Participatory budgeting**  
- **Procurement transparency**  
- **Municipal digital ID** for residency-based participation  

Cities are **ideal sandboxes**: smaller scale, high user engagement, and direct service delivery.
