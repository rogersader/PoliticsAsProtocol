# Politics as Protocol – Municipal Mapping (Canada Cities)

Cities in Canada exist under **provincial authority**, not federal. Municipal powers come from provincial statutes (e.g., Municipal Act, City of Toronto Act, Vancouver Charter, etc.).

This makes municipalities the **most flexible and innovation-ready** governance layer.

---

# 0. Municipal Snapshot (Canada)

- Municipalities are **creatures of provincial law**; they have no constitutional status.  
- Governed by:
  - **City Council** (mayor + councillors)
  - **Municipal bylaws**
  - **City Manager / CAO + municipal departments**
- Key domains:
  - Land use & zoning  
  - Policing (municipal or RCMP contract)
  - Fire services  
  - Transit  
  - Water & waste  
  - Local roads & infrastructure  
  - Housing policy  
  - Permits & business licensing  
  - Parks & recreation  

Municipalities are where **governance meets citizens daily**, making them ideal for protocolization.

  - Boundaries:
    - Zone change acceptance  
    - Transit project preferences  
    - Budget priorities  
- **Ward-specific governance channels**

# 🔍 TL;DR – City as Protocol

Cities are the **fastest to adopt on-chain governance** because:

- They control highly visible daily services.
- They have clearer lines of accountability (mayor + councillors).
- Citizen engagement is far higher on local issues.
- They can pilot protocol governance **without constitutional amendment**.
- They can integrate:
  - Permits  
  - Zoning  
  - Budgets  
  - Planning  
  - Public consultations  
  directly into an on-chain lifecycle.

**Minimal viable path for municipalities:**
1. On-chain bylaw & permit hashing.  
2. Digital municipal ID (residency-based).  
3. Ward-based consultation channels.  
4. Participatory budgeting.  
5. Zoning applications + public comments anchored on-chain.  
6. Transparency dashboards for procurement, police boards, and budgets.

This becomes a **full governance co-processor for cities**—augmenting democracy and transparency with zero disruption to constitutional order.
