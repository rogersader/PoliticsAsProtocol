# PoliticsAsProtocol  
### The 9-Layer Governance Protocol Model

This section defines the **foundational model** used across the entire repository.  
It expresses politics as a layered protocol—actors, decisions, rights, and processes—similar to how software systems define modular components.

---

## Overview

The **9-layer governance stack** abstracts any political system into composable parts:

1. **Governance Domain Model**  
2. **Identity & Access**  
3. **Representation & Delegation**  
4. **Proposal Lifecycle**  
5. **Deliberation & Voting**  
6. **Policy Encoding & Execution**  
7. **Constitutional Constraints**  
8. **Infrastructure (Chain / Hybrid)**  
9. **Security, Inclusivity & Resilience**

This model acts as the **base specification** for mapping Canada’s political systems—federal, provincial, and municipal—into consistent, protocol-centric structures.
